EAWebKit is a port by Electronic Arts of the [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) project. It aims to provide a way to integrate web content (HTML/CSS/JS) into video games and run on modern gaming platforms as well as providing hooks for game engines for memory management, text rendering, etc.

EAWebKit is open-sourced by Electronic Arts and the official source code can be downloaded at https://gpl.ea.com/eawebkit.html.
